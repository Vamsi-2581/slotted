/**
 * The region that stands in for content that is not there, and says what to do
 * next: a title, a description, the controls that get the reader out, and a
 * line of documentation under them. The page's own illustration goes above
 * them where there is one; the family draws none of its own (RS1).
 *
 * It is not `alert`. An alert sits beside the content it is about; this
 * replaces it. `inline-message` is a line of text under one control.
 *
 * **The box is a landmark, not a live region.** It renders a `section`, named
 * by its own title through `aria-labelledby`, so a reader can jump to it; the
 * region that announces is `ResultStateContent`, which holds only the text.
 * MDN's `alert` role reference is explicit that the role "should only be used
 * for text content, not interactive elements such as links or buttons".
 *
 * **It announces by default.** WCAG 2.2's Understanding document for SC 4.1.3
 * names this family's own text as its example of a status message: "brief text
 * messages displayed about the completion or status of the search, such as
 * 'Searching…', '18 results returned' or 'No results returned' would be status
 * updates if they do not take focus or cause a page refresh." `alert` defaults
 * to silence because an alert may be a standing notice; a result is always the
 * outcome of an operation. None of the seven surveyed implementations writes a
 * live role of any kind.
 *
 * **The keyboard has somewhere to go.** The root carries `tabIndex={-1}`, so an
 * application that has just emptied a table can send the reader to the message
 * through the ref. The family never moves focus by itself — that would be a
 * change of context nobody asked for.
